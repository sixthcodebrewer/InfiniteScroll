# Virtualized Infinite Scroll Implementation

This project implements a bidirectional infinite scroll using React Window virtualization. The implementation maintains a sliding window of 30 items (10 previous, 10 current, 10 next) to optimize memory usage and performance.

## Key Features

- **React Window Virtualization**: Only renders visible items in the DOM
- **Bidirectional Scrolling**: Load more items when scrolling up or down
- **Memory Optimization**: Maintains only 30 items in memory
- **Debounced Scroll Handling**: Prevents excessive API calls
- **Debug Panel**: Shows current state for development

## Implementation Details

### Core Components


### Data Management
- Maintains a sliding window of 30 items
- Removes oldest 10 items when loading new ones
- Updates skip value to track pagination

### Scroll Detection
- Triggers load when scrolling near top/bottom
- Uses debounced scroll handler
- Maintains scroll position during updates

## Advantages and Limitations

### Pros ✅

1. **Performance**
   - Virtualized rendering minimizes DOM elements
   - Efficient memory usage with sliding window
   - Smooth scrolling experience

2. **User Experience**
   - Seamless infinite scroll in both directions
   - Minimal layout shift during loading
   - Responsive to user interactions

3. **Development**
   - Clean and maintainable code structure
   - Easy to debug with debug panel
   - Modular component design

### Cons ❌

1. **Technical Limitations**
   - Fixed window size of 30 items
   - Potential data loss during rapid scrolling
   - No data persistence between sessions

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Limited error handling
   - No retry mechanism for failed requests
   - Scroll position might jump in certain conditions

3. **User Experience Gaps**
   - Limited feedback during errors
   - No loading indicators for individual items
   - No way to jump to specific positions



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
